# Dev Config Generator
## _App is inspired by [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix)_
The reason why I have decided to build this tool is for my usecase as I struggled to use mix to do both such as use stand alone [Node Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and inject it into [Browsersync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync]) simultaneosly. 

If you are not planning to do the same you'd better [Laravel.mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix) use
